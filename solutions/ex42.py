t = n(n+1)/2
2t = n^2 + n
n^2 + n - 2t = 0

if the roots of the above quadratic are integers, i.e. n is an integer, then t is a triangle number 
so we plug into quadratic formula:

n = (-1 Â± sqrt(1 + 8t))/2

clearly, the only fractional component could come from sqrt(1 + 8t)
if 1+ 8t is a perfect square, then t is a triangle number
